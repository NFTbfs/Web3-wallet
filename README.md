Web 3 Starter is a modern web 3 starter template project.

Here's the full stack of frameworks/libraries used:

- Next.js React
- TailwindCSS for styling
- [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev/) for Tailwind components
- [@rainbow-me/rainbowkit](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit) to connect to ethereum wallets
- [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) for toast messages
- [unstated-next](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated-next) for state management
- [next-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) for dark mode theme

## How to Setup Development Environment

#### A. Start the local hardhat ethereum node

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

#### B. In a seperate shell, start the NextJS Server.

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your app.

## First Time Project Template Setup

#### 1. Create a `.env` file.

```bash
# Private key used for testnets (ropsten)
ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=""

# This is the private key you will used to deploy to mainnet
ETH_MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY=""

# This API Key is used for Etherscan contract verifications
# To obtain the API Key go here -> https://etherscan.io/apis
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=""

# This is the address of the contract that will be used in production
# You'll neeed to set it here, and in Vercel (or wherever you choose
# to deploy the app.)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=""

# Name of the network contract is deployed on
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME=""

# This API is needed when you run `npx hardhat test` -- so that
# you can approximate the cost of deployin your contract on mainnet
COIN_MARKETCAP_API_KEY=""
```
